>This section contains all string related questions and problems


- Problem 1 - **UNIQUE CHARS** Determine string has all UNIQUE chars or not. <Without extra space>

- Problem 2 - **ANAGRAM** Given 2 Strings; check one is PERMUTATION of the other

- Problem 3 - **URLify**: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
Ex: Input : "Mr John Smith ", 13" 
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

- Problem 4 - **Pallindrome Permutation**: 
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

- Problem 5 - **One Away**: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
pale, ple -> true
pales, pale -> true
pale, bale -> true
pale, bake -> false

- Problem 6 - **String Compression**: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

- Problem 7 - **String Rotation**: Assume you have a method isSubstring() which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").
